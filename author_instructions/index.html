          <h2>For authors</h2>
          <h3>Before the presentation/conference</h3>
          
          Make sure that you record your presentation (audio + video). While we do not recommend any recording tool, we would like to suggest following the procedure explained below for recording the presentation.
          
          <ul>
          <li> The recording should not exceed the allocated presentation time of 25 minutes.</li>
          <li> The recording should be with a minimal duration of 15 minutes, but not longer then 20 minutes</li>
          <li> There will 5-10 minutes Q&A session after each talk.</li>
          <li> Make your presentation available for download through for instance, Dropbox or any file sharing site. You must share the recording link no later than 2 days before the presentation schedule. The recordings will allow us to address any last-minute technical glitch like lack of or limited connection.</li>
          <li> Setup your equipment. </li>
          <li> To avoid any noise and echo, we recommend getting a headset and microphone if you already do not have them. </li>
          <li> Test your audio and video. </li>
     
            
          </ul>
          
          <h3>During the session</h3>
          <ul>
            <li> AIOPS is running on the first day in the conference. It will run in a meeting mode. </li>
            <li> A panelist, host, co-host, etc. will control attendees’ participations to ensure a smooth progress of the sessions. </li>
            <li> Test your audio and video. </li>
          </ul>  
          
        <h4> To ask questions:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li> Virtually raise your hand using the appropriate Zoom button. </li>
            <li> You will be granted audio (and video, if you wish) permission. </li>
            <li> Use the microphone when speaking. </li>
            
            <li> Make sure the microphone is on and close enough to pick up the voice. </li>
            <li> If you are not talking, mute/turn off the microphone. </li>
            <li> Avoid disturbing activities like typing and using other electronic devices while the microphone is enabled. </li>
            <li> Attendees can also type their questions or comments through the Q&A messenger to interact with the paper’s presenter and/or session’s chair. </li>
         
            
            </ul>  
        <h3>After the session</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>  A gather.town session will be open for networking purposes too (to replace the coffee break). </li>
        </ul>
          
        
        <h3>Presentation recoding guidelines</h3>
        The recording of the presentation is mandatory for all presentations at AIOPS 2020. The recordings will allow us to address any last-minute technical glitches like lack of or limited connection. The easiest way of performing such a recording is to use one of the widely available conferencing tools, democratized by the pandemic. Here are some of these tools:
        <ul>
           <li> WebEx: Video Conferencing – Record a Cisco Webex Meeting</li>
           <li> Skype: Skype for Business: Recording a Meeting | Information Technology Services | Bemidji State University</li>
           <li> Google Meet: Record a video meeting – Meet Help</li>
           <li> Zoom: Local Recording – Zoom Help Center</li>
           <li> Gotomeeting: How to Record a GoToMeeting Session | Techwalla and How to Convert and Open the GoToMeeting Recordings</li>
           <li> Microsoft Teams: Record a meeting in Teams – Office Support</li>
                
        </ul>  

        You can also use the two step method covered below:     
          <ul>
          <li> Create Voice Over Power point and convert to MP4 </li> 
          </ul>  
          
         When recording, you can include your face in the video (enable the webcam if you would like – this is not mandatory). The slides are displayed as you talk. Make sure that you get a high quality recording  
         You can use any meeting software as long as you get a good quality recording, preferably in MP4 format.
         While we leave the authors free to choose the platform for their recording, our recommended approach to record a compatible video from content displayed on your computer screen and voice recorded via the computer microphone, is to record the presentation using Zoom, available to users on most platforms and in most countries:
         
         Instructions for recording your presentation with Zoom: <href> https://ieeetv.ieee.org/mobile/video/recording-your-presentation-with-zoom</href> 

          <h3> Guidelines for preparing your video </h3>
          
          <ul>
          <li> Duration: 15 minutes (short papers) or 25 minutes (long papers)
          <li> File size: 250MB max
          <li> Video file format: Preferably mp4
          <li> Dimensions: Minimum height 480 pixels, aspect ratio: 16:9
          <li> Please be sure the video includes the title of the paper, the authors, and a mention to AIOPS 2020 and ICSOC 2020. We suggest you share the video with us ahead of time so that we can review it and allow some time in case anything going wrong to be fixed.
          <li> Finally, please name your fine with your paper ID, e.g., for paper ID = 10 and presenter "SURNAME" the video file should be like 10_SURNAME.mpg4 (in case the format is mpg4) </li>
          <\ul>
            


Tips for Recording:
Use as quiet an area as possible
Avoid areas that have echo
Rooms should be fairly small
Sound dampening with carpeting, curtains, furniture
Hardline internet connection recommended, but if unavailable, a strong Wi-Fi connection
Good headset with microphone close to mouth BUT away from direct line of mouth to reduce “pops”.  Avoid using default built-in microphone on computer.
Do a test recording of a couple of minutes and review the sound and picture quality, MP4 format, and bit rate before recording the entire presentation.  Make adjustments if needed.
